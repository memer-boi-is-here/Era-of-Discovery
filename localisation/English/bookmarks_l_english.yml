With the slim amount of allies at France's disposal, Henry will have to turn to the Ottomans and seal yet another controversial alliance just as his father had done fourteen years prior. With France surrounded on all sides by the Habsburgs, it will be a challenge to take back Italy, but if France can manage to take Italy they will become the predominate European superpower and tilt the balance of power in Europe towards the French rather than the Habsburgs."

The country is also still reeling from the internal religious division due to Henry VIII having officially made England a Protestant country only sixteen years prior.

England is currently at war between France and Scotland over Edward's marriage to young Scottish queen Mary Stuart. Will England prevail in this war of the Rough Wooing and finally unite England and Scotland, or will they fail and become ever more weak?

 SPR_SCENARIO_1550_DESC:0 "Throughout the 16th century, Spain has become the wealthiest and most powerful country in all of Europe. With Spain's monopoly of the colonies in the New World, tons of resources and precious metals are flowing into Spain each day. The Habsburg monarch Charles I is currently the most powerful man in all of Europe ruling all of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain. Now France threatens yet again the Spanish lands of Milan and Naples in Italy. If Charles can win this war it will further solidify his power and prestige throughout all of Europe and show the Habsburgs and not the French are the true rulers of Europe."
 AUS_SCENARIO_1550_DESC:0 "As the head state of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria has increasingly grown in power and importance in Europe during the 16th century. In 1521 Charles V entrusted the Archduchy of Austria to his younger brother Ferdinand I to rule in his name. When the Prostestant Reformation erupted in the Holy Roman Empire in 1517, Ferdinand took on a tough job trying to quell Protestant rebellions within the empire and defend against Ottoman attacks all along Austria's southern border. With the Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand began to recognize the severity of the situation and began to reinforce his border with the Ottoman Empire in order to prevent another siege on Vienna."
 RUS_SCENARIO_1550_DESC:0 "The backward and medieval ways of Russia have hindered much of the country's expansion and advancement throughout the 16th century. With the accession of Ivan IV in 1547, he began to modernize Russia internally to the point that Russia finally became an Empire and Ivan eventually became the first Tsar of Russia. Ivan IV began to found a standing army in Russia which helped him expand the territory of his new empire. It seems that Ivan may yet again go to war to expand his empire. Kazan has been provoking many border skirmishes recently and it now looks that Ivan is about to declare war. For Russia to advance in the world, Ivan IV will need to create close ties with the rest of Europe to gain allies and have access to trade."
 SWE_SCENARIO_1550_DESC:0 "With the ultimate dissolution of the Kalmar Union in 1521, Sweden emerged as an independent kingdom once again and elected Gustav I as the first king of the new independent Sweden. For the early part of Gustav's reign, he had to defend against many attempts by the Danish to retake Sweden and reinstate the Kalmar Union. Due to many European countries seeing Gustav as a usurper of the throne of Sweden and with his low amount of funds in the swedish treasury, Gustav decided to make Lutheranism the state religion which gave him control of the church's money coffers. Tensions between Sweden and Russia have almost come to a breaking point it looks like war may happen in the near future."
 POR_SCENARIO_1550_DESC:0 "Even though Portugal was the first European country to set off on exploration, it soon became overshadowed by the ever increasing exploits of Spain; Portugal quickly fell behind in the race for colonization. The Portuguese were eventually successful in colonizing Brazil and incorporated it into an official colony in 1549. Portuguese colonies in India and Africa have provided for much of the countries resources. Portugal's monopoly of trade with India made the country very wealthy for most of the 16th century. With the tensions between France and the Habsburgs growing in Europe, John III has decided to remain neutral in order to not push Portugal into an long and costly war."
 TUR_SCENARIO_1550_DESC:0 "During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire has grown to be one of the strongest empires in the world. His reign is considered the "Golden Age" of the Ottoman Empire in its artistic, literary, and architectural advancements. Suleiman even went as far as to siege Vienna in 1529 where he almost scored a victory over Christendom. Due to the massive empire that Suleiman has carved out, many people from different cultures have begun to sew discontent throughout the empire which has greatly hurt the economy of the Ottoman Empire. The intense rivalry between the Austrian Habsburgs and the Ottomans seems to be at the breaking point once again. France has also expressed interest in allying yet again to crush their mutual enemies."
